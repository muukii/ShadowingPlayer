00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,130
Unknown: Hello everyone, this is
Luke Thompson and you're

2
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:05,790
listening to a phrasal verb day.
This is where I attempt to teach

3
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:09,690
you a phrasal verb every day for
a year. And yes, this project is

4
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:13,620
still ongoing. A phrasal verb a
day is back and in this episode,

5
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:17,430
I'm going to teach you some more
common phrasal verbs as we

6
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:22,830
continue on this mission to get
to 365 days of phrasal verbs.

7
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:25,740
Now I'm going to talk to you
about phrasal verbs with the

8
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:29,880
word pop. And there are a lot.
Also I want to say that a

9
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:34,440
phrasal verb a day will continue
after this episode, but not

10
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:39,270
here. In this RSS feed. All the
new episodes of phrasal verb day

11
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:43,350
will appear in the Luke's
English podcast app, and online

12
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:50,370
at teacher luke.co.uk/p V. Okay,
over the next days or weeks 10

13
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:54,000
more episodes of a phrasal verb
a day will appear in the app.

14
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:57,150
I'll talk to you more about that
in a moment. First, let me just

15
00:00:57,150 --> 00:01:00,840
remind you of this project and
what this is all about. So this

16
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:04,200
is where I teach you phrasal
verbs, these essential bits of

17
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:08,610
natural English. Originally, I
plan to do one of these every

18
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:12,180
day. But after a couple of
months, it became impossible to

19
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:15,330
do that every day. I've added
more episodes over the years.

20
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:20,400
And we're currently on number
139. I think in fact, this one

21
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,680
that you're listening to
listening to right now is number

22
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:27,750
140. Well, it's time to revive
this series and do so in the

23
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:30,840
Luke's English podcast app,
which I expect is where you're

24
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:35,070
listening to this. If you're not
listening to it, then move over

25
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:38,550
to the app because that's where
the new episodes will arrive. So

26
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:41,640
what I do in these episodes is
explain and demonstrate various

27
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:45,990
phrasal verbs. I think the best
way to learn vocabulary is to

28
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:50,220
hear it being used in context
with vivid examples. And I

29
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:53,820
always try to do this sometimes
having a bit of fun with some of

30
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:56,940
the scenarios. And all of it's
designed to help you learn these

31
00:01:56,940 --> 00:02:00,660
crucial bits of English. Phrasal
verbs are crucial because this

32
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:04,110
is exactly the way that native
speakers use the language. But

33
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:06,420
learners of English have trouble
with them because they are

34
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:10,080
idiomatic. They're tricky in
structure. And they don't exist

35
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:15,210
as grammatical forms in their
languages. But let's carry on

36
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:18,750
them with a big one. And we're
looking at the word pop. So

37
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:22,590
these are phrasal verbs with
pop. This is extremely common

38
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:25,470
and quite versatile. It's
absolutely one of the most

39
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:29,370
common little phrases used every
day all over the country. It's

40
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:33,360
informal, but it's polite. It's
kind of nice and light. So let's

41
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,180
hear about it. And you get we're
going to hear phrases like pop

42
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:41,160
in pop off, pop on pop out, pop
over, pop round and pop up as

43
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:48,090
well. So pop P O P, it can mean
lots of things. It can mean to

44
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:51,450
go it can mean to move
something, it can mean to leave,

45
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:55,890
to visit, to appear lots of
different things, let's go

46
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:58,920
through them all we'll start
with pop in, this is maybe the

47
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:03,690
most common one pop in also pop
into a place. And to pop in

48
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:07,350
means to go somewhere, just for
a quick visit, just go somewhere

49
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:10,080
quickly, you go somewhere you
stay there for only a short

50
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,850
time. So you pop in. For
example, you might say, I'll pop

51
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:19,320
in later. And, you know, I'll
pop in later and talk to you

52
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:24,180
about the podcast, for example.
I'll pop in this afternoon, you

53
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:28,410
know, I managed to pop into the
bank to get all that paperwork

54
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:32,040
done. For example, okay, uh,
popped into the blue laundry, or

55
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:35,760
popped into, you know, the
supermarket, you know, or do you

56
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,120
want to pop in later. And we'll
talk about that thing. For

57
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:44,640
example to pop in. Also, you
have pop in to do, for example.

58
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:50,070
So, you know, I popped in to
make a reservation at the

59
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:56,610
restaurant. Okay, that's pop in,
then we have pop on. And this

60
00:03:56,610 --> 00:04:02,550
means to move something to put
an item or, or to put something

61
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:06,120
on a particular in a particular
place to pop it on the tape,

62
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,630
just pop that on the table, just
pop it on the shelf there,

63
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:13,830
that's great. Just pop that on
the back of the chair. Okay, pop

64
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:19,410
on to put also to put an item of
clothing on, you know, just just

65
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:24,900
pop your coat on. And we'll go
out again, it's so common, it's

66
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:27,600
just strikes me as being so
common that that kind of

67
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,300
language, so I just, you know,
thought we'd just pop out to the

68
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:35,070
shops. So just pop your shoes
and coat on and off we pop. Just

69
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:38,190
very common language and it
sounds quite nice. It's

70
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:41,220
informal, but that's not a bad
thing. It's informal, but it's

71
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:44,910
kind of the right kind of tone.
You might hear a doctor say the

72
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:47,790
word pop, it's exactly the sort
of thing a doctor would say, to

73
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:51,390
try and put you at ease. So just
put yourself down on the chair.

74
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:56,040
They've just want to just just
pop your clothes off and just

75
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:59,460
pop onto this. This bed here.
Just pop this into your mouth.

76
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,800
You know that To the sort of
thing that doctors say, anyway,

77
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:05,460
we've had pop in and pop on,
just pop your coat on, let's go

78
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:11,310
for a walk. Okay. We also have
pop out, which is very common,

79
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,930
meaning to leave quickly or just
to leave for a short time. You

80
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:18,570
know, so where's Dave? Oh, he's
just popped out, it will be back

81
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:22,440
in a minute. Dave's just popped
out, he'll be back in a minute.

82
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:26,640
Okay, I'm just popping out, you
know, just popping out to get

83
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:32,280
some windscreen washer fluid.
Anyone want to join me breath of

84
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:35,340
fresh air, you know, just
popping out to the to the

85
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:39,480
carriage, for example, popping
out to do something I'm just

86
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:43,200
popping out to post a letter,
I'll be back in a few minutes

87
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:51,930
pop out to do something. Okay,
that's to pop out pop over. That

88
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:55,170
would be to visit a someone at
their house for a short time.

89
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:59,070
I'll just I'll pop over later
on. And we'll have a cup of tea.

90
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:02,850
Okay, it's a bit like to pop in
or pop in later, I'll pop over

91
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,300
later over suggesting that you
know the distance between where

92
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:10,140
you are now and where the person
lives or pop over later on.

93
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:15,240
Okay, pop round is also the same
kind of thing, basically, to

94
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:18,450
visit someone quickly or for a
short time. It's like pop in,

95
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:23,580
pop over or pop round. Okay, so,
you know, pop rock, Could you

96
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:26,190
Could you do me a favor? Could
you pop round later, I just want

97
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:30,360
to ask you something. Okay, or
pop round to do something. I'm

98
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:33,990
just popping around to ask you
if you've got those papers that

99
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:37,650
we're talking about. Lots of
lots of distribution of papers

100
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:40,380
going on in this episode isn't
there, everyone's popping in and

101
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:44,790
out with different papers, then
we've got to pop up. And this

102
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:49,860
means to appear quickly or
suddenly to pop up. Okay, I

103
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:52,560
mean, you know this from
computers, because when you're

104
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:55,950
using a computer, sometimes you
get popups these are like

105
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:59,760
annoying adverts that pop up
they just appear quickly. And

106
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:04,380
you have to kind of try and
close them pop up adverts. But

107
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:08,280
pop up just means you know,
arrive or appear quickly. Like

108
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:11,850
this issue pops up sometimes. Or
that the you know, the question

109
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:17,490
of the papers popped up again at
the meeting. And flowers might

110
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:20,490
pop up as well. You know, in the
spring you start to see flowers

111
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:25,620
popping up here and there. Also,
we use pop up as an adjective

112
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:30,210
like a pop up book, or a pop up
card, which has pictures inside

113
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:35,100
that stand up when you open the
pages. A pop up toaster pushes

114
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:38,370
the piece of bread up so the
toast pops up when it's ready.

115
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:44,250
Okay, and a pop up ad as well as
we said. So there you go. Lots

116
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:48,450
and lots of different phrases
with pop there that I've just

117
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:51,780
been through. Now normally these
phrasal verb episodes are a bit

118
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:55,830
shorter than this. Normally,
they're just a few minutes. As I

119
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:58,410
said earlier, there will be
about 10 More of these phrasal

120
00:07:58,410 --> 00:08:03,000
verbs. Episodes arriving soon,
but they won't arrive here in

121
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,970
the phrasal verb a day podcast
feed. So if you're listening to

122
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:10,140
this in the Apple podcast app,
or some other app, they these

123
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:13,380
phrasal verb episodes will no
longer appear there. Instead,

124
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:16,650

136
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:01,680
now, I just like to say have a
very good day or morning or

137
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,170

00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:06,690
verb day and I'll speak to you
again on the podcast soon but

139

for now. Goodbye bye bye bye
