Unknown: Hello everyone,

2
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:03,930
this is Luke Thompson and you're listening to a phrasal verb day.

3
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:08,160
This is where I attempt to teach you a phrasal verb every day for a year.

4
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:10,800
And yes, this project is still ongoing.

5
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:13,620
A phrasal verb a day is back and in this episode,

6
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:22,830
I'm going to teach you some more common phrasal verbs as we continue on this mission to get to 365 days of phrasal verbs.

7
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:27,990
Now I'm going to talk to you about phrasal verbs with the word pop. And there are a lot.

8
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:36,690
Also I want to say that a phrasal verb a day will continue after this episode, but not here. In this RSS feed.

9
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:47,040
All the new episodes of phrasal verb day will appear in the Luke's English podcast app, and online at teacher luke.co.uk/p V.

10
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:54,000
Okay, over the next days or weeks 10 more episodes of a phrasal verb a day will appear in the app.

11
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:56,370
I'll talk to you more about that in a moment.

12
00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:00,330
First, let me just remind you of this project and what this is all about.

13
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:05,790
So this is where I teach you phrasal verbs, these essential bits of natural English.

14
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:13,110
Originally, I plan to do one of these every day. But after a couple of months, it became impossible to do that every day.

15
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:23,700
I've added more episodes over the years. And we're currently on number 139. I think in fact, this one that you're listening to listening to right now is number 140.

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:03:30,540
Well, it's time to revive this series and do so in the Luke's English podcast app, which I expect is where you're listening to this. If you're not listening to it, then move over to the app because
that's where the new episodes will arrive. So what I do in these episodes is explain and demonstrate various phrasal verbs. I think the best way to learn vocabulary is to hear it being used in context
with vivid examples. And I always try to do this sometimes having a bit of fun with some of the scenarios. And all of it's designed to help you learn these crucial bits of English. Phrasal verbs are
crucial because this is exactly the way that native speakers use the language. But learners of English have trouble with them because they are idiomatic. They're tricky in structure. And they don't
exist as grammatical forms in their languages. But let's carry on them with a big one. And we're looking at the word pop. So these are phrasal verbs with pop. This is extremely common and quite
versatile. It's absolutely one of the most common little phrases used every day all over the country. It's informal, but it's polite. It's kind of nice and light. So let's hear about it. And you get
we're going to hear phrases like pop in pop off, pop on pop out, pop over, pop round and pop up as well. So pop P O P, it can mean lots of things. It can mean to go it can mean to move something, it
can mean to leave, to visit, to appear lots of different things, let's go through them all we'll start with pop in, this is maybe the most common one pop in also pop into a place. And to pop in means
to go somewhere, just for a quick visit, just go somewhere quickly, you go somewhere you stay there for only a short time. So you pop in. For example, you might say, I'll pop in later. And, you know,
I'll pop in later and talk to you about the podcast, for example. I'll pop in this afternoon, you know, I managed to pop into the bank to get all that paperwork done. For example, okay, uh, popped

17
00:03:30,540 --> 00:05:42,510
into the blue laundry, or popped into, you know, the supermarket, you know, or do you want to pop in later. And we'll talk about that thing. For example to pop in. Also, you have pop in to do, for
example. So, you know, I popped in to make a reservation at the restaurant. Okay, that's pop in, then we have pop on. And this means to move something to put an item or, or to put something on a
particular in a particular place to pop it on the tape, just pop that on the table, just pop it on the shelf there, that's great. Just pop that on the back of the chair. Okay, pop on to put also to
put an item of clothing on, you know, just just pop your coat on. And we'll go out again, it's so common, it's just strikes me as being so common that that kind of language, so I just, you know,
thought we'd just pop out to the shops. So just pop your shoes and coat on and off we pop. Just very common language and it sounds quite nice. It's informal, but that's not a bad thing. It's informal,
but it's kind of the right kind of tone. You might hear a doctor say the word pop, it's exactly the sort of thing a doctor would say, to try and put you at ease. So just put yourself down on the
chair. They've just want to just just pop your clothes off and just pop onto this. This bed here. Just pop this into your mouth. You know that To the sort of thing that doctors say, anyway, we've had
pop in and pop on, just pop your coat on, let's go for a walk. Okay. We also have pop out, which is very common, meaning to leave quickly or just to leave for a short time. You know, so where's Dave?
Oh, he's just popped out, it will be back in a minute. Dave's just popped out, he'll be back in a minute. Okay, I'm just popping out, you know, just popping out to get some windscreen washer fluid.
Anyone want to join me breath of fresh air, you know, just popping out to the to the carriage, for example, popping out to do something I'm just popping out to post a letter, I'll be back in a few

18
00:05:42,510 --> 00:07:56,100
minutes pop out to do something. Okay, that's to pop out pop over. That would be to visit a someone at their house for a short time. I'll just I'll pop over later on. And we'll have a cup of tea.
Okay, it's a bit like to pop in or pop in later, I'll pop over later over suggesting that you know the distance between where you are now and where the person lives or pop over later on. Okay, pop
round is also the same kind of thing, basically, to visit someone quickly or for a short time. It's like pop in, pop over or pop round. Okay, so, you know, pop rock, Could you Could you do me a favor?
Could you pop round later, I just want to ask you something. Okay, or pop round to do something. I'm just popping around to ask you if you've got those papers that we're talking about. Lots of lots of
distribution of papers going on in this episode isn't there, everyone's popping in and out with different papers, then we've got to pop up. And this means to appear quickly or suddenly to pop up.
Okay, I mean, you know this from computers, because when you're using a computer, sometimes you get popups these are like annoying adverts that pop up they just appear quickly. And you have to kind of
try and close them pop up adverts. But pop up just means you know, arrive or appear quickly. Like this issue pops up sometimes. Or that the you know, the question of the papers popped up again at the
meeting. And flowers might pop up as well. You know, in the spring you start to see flowers popping up here and there. Also, we use pop up as an adjective like a pop up book, or a pop up card, which
has pictures inside that stand up when you open the pages. A pop up toaster pushes the piece of bread up so the toast pops up when it's ready. Okay, and a pop up ad as well as we said. So there you
go. Lots and lots of different phrases with pop there that I've just been through. Now normally these phrasal verb episodes are a bit shorter than this. Normally, they're just a few minutes. As I said

19
00:07:56,100 --> 00:09:09,390
earlier, there will be about 10 More of these phrasal verbs. Episodes arriving soon, but they won't arrive here in the phrasal verb a day podcast feed. So if you're listening to this in the Apple
podcast app, or some other app, they these phrasal verb episodes will no longer appear there. Instead, they'll pop up in the Luke's English podcast app. So get the app for your smartphone. You can
find it in the app store for iOS, Apple devices and Android phones. So you can find it in the in the app store there just download it and then in the app, you can use the side menu to find the phrasal
verb category and all the episodes will be there. You can also access and download the episodes online from teacher luke.co.uk/p V. The transcript collaboration for these episodes is also still going.
So if you'd like to contribute a transcript to a phrasal verb episode, go to my website, and then episodes and then hover over phrasal verb podcast and click transcript collaboration and that's where
you can get involved. But for now, I just like to say have a very good day or morning or evening or nights that this has been an episode of a phrasal verb day and I'll speak to you again on the
podcast soon but for now. Goodbye bye bye bye
