1
00:00:00,011 --> 00:00:01,011
The universe is magnificent and vast. Hundreds
of billions of galaxies, trillions of stars,

2
00:00:06,191 --> 00:00:07,191
and even more planets. If even the tiniest
fraction are habitable, then the Universe should

3
00:00:12,671 --> 00:00:13,671
be teeming with life. And yet we see nothing,
only vast emptiness. Where is everyone else?

4
00:00:20,231 --> 00:00:21,231
The answer to this riddle could be as exciting
as it is creepy: we are early, born before almost

5
00:00:27,791 --> 00:00:28,791
all other life – but very soon this may change.
Not only might aliens appear, they could quickly

6
00:00:35,771 --> 00:00:36,771
surround us. An irreversible competition
for the universe might be about to begin.

7
00:00:50,651 --> 00:00:51,651
While this video is based on scientific papers,
we are presenting interesting ideas based on

8
00:00:56,051 --> 00:00:57,051
little data and lots of extrapolation,
so take them with a grain of salt.

9
00:01:00,191 --> 00:01:01,191
Ok! We need to look at three essential questions
to understand the galactic competition:

10
00:01:07,271 --> 00:01:08,271
How fast can bacteria build spaceships?

11
00:01:10,451 --> 00:01:11,451
To become a starfaring civilization,

12
00:01:12,971 --> 00:01:13,971
life as we know it needs to master
a number of very hard steps.

13
00:01:16,931 --> 00:01:17,931
It starts with dead stuff turning
into the building blocks of life.

14
00:01:21,971 --> 00:01:22,971
Then it needs to organize into self-contained
cells. Those cells have to learn to work together

15
00:01:27,551 --> 00:01:28,551
to form multicellular organisms. This keeps going
until complex creatures with big brains learn to

16
00:01:34,631 --> 00:01:35,631
use tools and language. Civilization has to
be formed from cultures that value progress

17
00:01:40,691 --> 00:01:41,691
and technological development. And then they need
to actually venture out beyond their home planet.

18
00:01:46,188 --> 00:01:47,188
We don’t really know how hard these steps
are or how many of them are necessary. On

19
00:01:47,891 --> 00:01:48,891
Earth life appeared basically as soon as the
oceans formed. But then it took two billion

20
00:01:53,231 --> 00:01:54,231
years to make the step from single cells to
multicellular organisms, and two billion more

21
00:01:58,571 --> 00:01:59,571
for us to appear. Culture, civilization and
space travel developed super quickly though.

22
00:02:05,111 --> 00:02:06,111
Do things always take that long or was
this actually exceptionally fast? Also,

23
00:02:11,651 --> 00:02:12,651
passing one step does not mean the next one is
guaranteed: multicellularity evolved over 25

24
00:02:18,131 --> 00:02:19,131
times independently on Earth, but there’s
only one species that builds spaceships.

25
00:02:23,531 --> 00:02:24,531
We don’t know how many steps life needs to
pass and how long they take to give rise

26
00:02:28,271 --> 00:02:29,271
to a technological civilization but there
are probably many, and it is likely that,

27
00:02:33,011 --> 00:02:34,011
on trillions of planets, life has
been trying for billions of years.

28
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:38,991
Since we don’t see any other
technological civilizations out there,

29
00:02:41,531 --> 00:02:42,531
it might well be that we are a rare
exception. We might be among the first

30
00:02:45,971 --> 00:02:46,971
or even THE first technological
civilization in the milky way.

31
00:02:51,311 --> 00:02:52,311
But this is just one piece of the puzzle – on

32
00:02:54,431 --> 00:02:55,431
top of that we may have just
hit the perfect time window.

33
00:02:57,911 --> 00:02:58,911
Why does humanity exist at
this time in the Universe?

34
00:03:02,531 --> 00:03:03,531
The universe is already 13.8 billion years old,

35
00:03:05,651 --> 00:03:06,651
but it is unlikely that many other technological
civilizations had a chance to appear before us.

36
00:03:12,251 --> 00:03:13,251
Because in the earlier Universe life would
have had a pretty hard time to emerge,

37
00:03:16,631 --> 00:03:17,631
let alone thrive, because it
was such a hostile environment.

38
00:03:20,771 --> 00:03:21,771
Early stars constantly blew up, galaxies
crashed into each other and supermassive

39
00:03:26,351 --> 00:03:27,351
black holes vomited massive amounts of radiation.
Enough to sterilize galaxies over and over again.

40
00:03:33,371 --> 00:03:34,371
Our Sun was born right at the end of this cosmic
death show. The Universe has never been more

41
00:03:39,491 --> 00:03:40,491
welcoming to life than it is now. So humanity
has arrived at a very convenient spot in time,

42
00:03:45,491 --> 00:03:46,491
maybe the earliest reasonably possible
for life to thrive. What about the future?

43
00:03:51,251 --> 00:03:52,251
The Sun burns brighter than 90% of the stars
in our galaxy and will keep getting brighter.

44
00:03:57,011 --> 00:03:58,011
In about a billion years, it will boil all of
Earth’s oceans and then become a giant that

45
00:04:02,351 --> 00:04:03,351
swallows it whole. So in the galactic
context, the sun is very short-lived.

46
00:04:07,631 --> 00:04:08,631
Most stars are red dwarfs that can sustain
habitable planets for tens of trillions of years!

47
00:04:15,311 --> 00:04:16,311
Life on these planets has an incredibly long time
window to appear and pass the hard steps. Even

48
00:04:22,271 --> 00:04:23,271
knowing nothing about how rare or common life is,
this makes it way more likely for technological

49
00:04:27,311 --> 00:04:28,311
civilizations to appear on one of those long-lived
planets some time in the future than in the past.

50
00:04:32,171 --> 00:04:33,171
Because, if civilizations appear at
random in the Milky Way within a time

51
00:04:36,191 --> 00:04:37,191
window of a trillion years, then very
few, if any, would appear before today.

52
00:04:42,251 --> 00:04:43,251
Then a couple more arrive in this period
of a billion years that we are in,

53
00:04:46,091 --> 00:04:47,091
before all starfaring civilizations that
could ever exist emerge all together.

54
00:04:51,911 --> 00:04:52,911
This weird tsunami-like distribution is the result
of both the hard steps model and something else:

55
00:04:59,111 --> 00:05:00,111
A sort of deadline for any spacefaring
civilization. Any civilization coming

56
00:05:04,631 --> 00:05:05,631
after will find it hard to have room to survive,
so all potential life has to cram in before it.

57
00:05:11,891 --> 00:05:12,891
Humanity exists now because otherwise
we might have missed this deadline.

58
00:05:17,831 --> 00:05:18,831
What or who creates this deadline?

59
00:05:21,971 --> 00:05:22,971
Why aren’t aliens already on Earth?

60
00:05:25,991 --> 00:05:26,991
Humans are curious, expansionist and hungry for
energy. We have spread over the world and made it

61
00:05:32,411 --> 00:05:33,411
our own. Our technology has been improving over
time, first slowly, then breathtakingly fast.

62
00:05:39,611 --> 00:05:40,611
If these things do not change drastically,
and our descendants want to prosper,

63
00:05:44,111 --> 00:05:45,111
they will expand into space. We could construct
a dyson swarm for endless energy and transform

64
00:05:51,191 --> 00:05:52,191
planets into new homes. We could cross
interstellar distances, allowing us to reach

65
00:05:56,471 --> 00:05:57,471
for planets around distant stars. If we have the
motivation we can become a galactic civilization.

66
00:06:03,731 --> 00:06:04,731
A civilization that does this sort of stuff can
be called “loud”, because its activity creates

67
00:06:09,131 --> 00:06:10,131
“noise”. Signs that can be detected from far away.
Imagine someone in a forest, cutting down trees,

68
00:06:16,331 --> 00:06:17,331
starting fires and laying down roads. The more
intense their work, the easier they are to notice.

69
00:06:22,751 --> 00:06:23,751
An expanding technological
civilization would probably

70
00:06:26,171 --> 00:06:27,171
be hard to miss. Our telescopes
would pick up all that energy and

71
00:06:30,191 --> 00:06:31,191
we would clearly identify artificial
interference with stars and planets.

72
00:06:34,991 --> 00:06:35,991
Another consequence of this business is that
it is very disruptive to the environment.

73
00:06:39,971 --> 00:06:40,971
Clearing a forest means the end of its wildlife.
Human activity has left no chance for a squirrel

74
00:06:46,151 --> 00:06:47,151
civilization to appear. Not because we hated
squirrels, it’s simply that the thought that

75
00:06:51,431 --> 00:06:52,431
they might want to do that at some point
never crossed our minds and we needed wood.

76
00:06:56,351 --> 00:06:57,351
Similarly, if Loud civilizations were
running around the galaxy in the past,

77
00:07:00,371 --> 00:07:01,371
terraforming planets or harvesting the energy
of stars, they may have prevented our existence.

78
00:07:06,491 --> 00:07:07,491
Had aliens started colonising earth
while we were still sludge in the oceans,

79
00:07:10,391 --> 00:07:11,391
that sludge would never have turned into
humans. This is how loud aliens create a

80
00:07:16,691 --> 00:07:17,691
deadline for new civilizations appearing.
The galaxy may have trillions of years

81
00:07:21,311 --> 00:07:22,311
to create life, but there may only be a
short window for it to spread and thrive.

82
00:07:26,471 --> 00:07:27,471
Even if a loud civilization respects planets with
naturally-occuring life and expands around them,

83
00:07:32,051 --> 00:07:33,051
like humans do with wildlife reserves
– any civilization on such a planet

84
00:07:36,551 --> 00:07:37,551
would not be able to expand, ever.
Trapped forever on a tiny island.

85
00:07:42,671 --> 00:07:43,671
But here we are, so Loud aliens
were probably never here.

86
00:07:47,291 --> 00:07:48,291
What about aliens that don’t expand? They would
be ‘Quiet’ aliens. They’re probably limited to one

87
00:07:54,011 --> 00:07:55,011
star system and don’t have a noticeable impact
on their cosmic surroundings. Humanity is like

88
00:07:59,711 --> 00:08:00,711
this right now. We wouldn’t be able to detect
ourselves from the other side of the Milky Way.

89
00:08:04,931 --> 00:08:05,931
If they stay quiet forever, maybe
because of their culture or abilities,

90
00:08:08,531 --> 00:08:09,531
then they are not really a concern for us.

91
00:08:11,831 --> 00:08:12,831
We only have one sample to draw from: Humanity,
and right now we are on the path to becoming loud.

92
00:08:19,511 --> 00:08:20,511
If we are not special, and succeed
anyway, then any other civilization

93
00:08:23,651 --> 00:08:24,651
with the motivation and resources to would
eventually expand beyond its planet of origin.


94
00:08:29,231 --> 00:08:30,231
Ok, what is the consequence of
all these assumptions and ideas?

95
00:08:34,391 --> 00:08:35,391
Grave consequences: Race to the Stars

96
00:08:38,531 --> 00:08:39,531
If we are really early, then eventually, others
will catch up with us. Civilizations will emerge

97
00:08:44,591 --> 00:08:45,591
all over the place. And these new aliens will
look at space, see no signs of life and come

98
00:08:49,991 --> 00:08:50,991
to the same conclusion: they exist because Loud
civilizations have not yet taken over everything,

99
00:08:55,151 --> 00:08:56,151
but it only takes one Loud civilization
to crowd them out of the entire galaxy.

100
00:09:01,151 --> 00:09:02,151
They, like us, will face an important decision:
do they stay Quiet, take it easy and tend to

101
00:09:07,991 --> 00:09:08,991
their planet for as long as possible, or do they
start expanding to take a chunk of the galaxy,

102
00:09:12,791 --> 00:09:13,791
before someone else arrives? Meeting others
does not necessarily mean war or conflict. But

103
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:21,291
it means that new borders will arise, limits
that may persist forever. In the worst case,

104
00:09:25,631 --> 00:09:26,631
a civilization could be completely
enveloped by the empires of others,

105
00:09:30,311 --> 00:09:31,311
eternally doomed to be a galactic
backwater, without control over their fate.

106
00:09:35,651 --> 00:09:36,651
So if we want a seat at
the galactic adults’ table,

107
00:09:38,591 --> 00:09:39,591
we best get to work. If we really are early, we
have an incredible opportunity. To mold thousands

108
00:09:46,271 --> 00:09:47,271
or even millions of planets according
to our vision and dreams. And one day,

109
00:09:52,211 --> 00:09:53,211
when we meet others, we can greet them and
meet them as equals. Wouldn’t that be nice?
