3
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:01,170

4
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:02,070
magnificent

5
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:02,340
and

6
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:02,940
vast.

7
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:03,870
Hundreds of

00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:04,290
billions

9
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:04,410

00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:05,610
trillions

12
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:05,730

even

15
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:07,080
more

16
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:07,620
planets.

17
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:08,550
If

18
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:08,940
even

19
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:09,030
the

00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:11,130
habitable,

24
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:11,580
then

25
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:11,640
the

27
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:12,540
should

00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:12,750
be

29
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:13,200
teeming

30
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:13,380
with

31
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:13,800
life.

32
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:14,370
And

33
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:14,580
yet

34
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:14,670
we

35
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:14,880
see

36
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:15,270
nothing,

37
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:15,810
only

38
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:16,320
vast

39
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:17,100
emptiness.

40
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:18,300
Where

41
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:18,420
is

42
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:18,750
everyone

43
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:19,200
else?

44
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:20,580
The

45
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:20,940
answer

46
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:21,060
to

47
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:21,240
this

48
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:21,630
riddle

49
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:22,020
could

50
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:22,320
be as

51
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:23,100
exciting

52
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:23,640
as it

53
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:23,850
is

54
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:24,510
creepy:

55
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:25,560
we

56
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:25,890
are

57
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:26,400
early,

58
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:27,060
born

59
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:27,420
before

60
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:27,870
almost

61
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:28,050
all

62
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:28,260
other

63
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:28,650
life

64
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:29,880
– but

65
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:30,270
very

66
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:30,660
soon

67
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:31,230
this

68
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:31,470
may

69
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:32,100
change.

70
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:33,270
Not

71
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:33,510
only

72
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:33,750
might

73
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:34,170
aliens

74
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:34,590
appear,

75
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:35,070
they

76
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:35,250
could

77
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:35,700
quickly

78
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:36,300
surround

79
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:36,690
us.

80
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:37,320
An

81
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:38,130
irreversible

82
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:38,820
competition

83
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:38,940
for

84
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:39,060
the

85
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:39,690
universe

86
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:40,110
might

87
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:40,290
be

88
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:40,680
about

89
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:40,770
to

90
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:41,190
begin.

91
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:51,180
While

92
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:51,420
this

93
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:51,780
video

94
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:51,930
is

95
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:52,260
based

96
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:52,380
on

97
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:52,980
scientific

98
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:53,460
papers,

99
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:53,820
we

100
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:53,850
are

101
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:54,360
presenting

102
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:54,900
interesting

103
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:55,380
ideas

104
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:55,770
based

105
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:55,950
on

106
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:56,250
little

108
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:57,090
and

109
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:57,390
lots

110
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:57,480
of

extrapolation,

112
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:58,860
so

113
00:00:58,890 --> 00:00:59,160
take

114
00:00:59,160 --> 00:00:59,310
them

115
00:00:59,310 --> 00:00:59,430
with

00:00:59,430 --> 00:00:59,490
a

118
00:00:59,730 --> 00:00:59,820
of

119
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:00,240
salt.

120
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:01,500
Ok!

121
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:02,070
We

122
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:02,250
need

123
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:02,340
to

124
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:02,520
look

125
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:02,610
at

126
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:02,910
three

127
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:03,360
essential

128
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:03,840
questions

129
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:04,050
to

130
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:04,620
understand

131
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:04,710
the

133
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:05,910
competition:

134
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:07,950
How

135
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:08,490
fast

136
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:08,760
can

137
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:09,480
bacteria

138
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:09,780
build

139
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:10,500
spaceships?

140
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:11,160
To

141
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:11,520
become

142
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:11,610
a

civilization,

145
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:13,710
life

146
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:14,070
as we

147
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:14,250
know

148
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:14,400
it

149
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:14,700
needs

150
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:14,820
to

151
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:15,180
master

152
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:15,240
a

154
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:15,720
of

155
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:16,050
very

156
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:16,380
hard

157
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:16,920
steps.

158
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:18,150
It

159
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:18,690
starts

160
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:18,900
with

161
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:19,170
dead

162
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:19,500
stuff

163
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:19,860
turning

164
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:20,070
into

165
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:20,190
the

166
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:20,550
building

167
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:20,880
blocks

168
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:21,000
of

169
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:21,390
life.

170
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:22,350
Then

171
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:22,470
it

172
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:22,710
needs

173
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:22,860
to

174
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:23,400
organize

175
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:23,700

00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:24,540
self-contained

177
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:25,140

178
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:25,950
Those

179
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:26,310
cells

180
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:26,460
have

00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:26,580
to

182
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:26,850
learn

183
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:26,970
to

184
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:27,300
work

185
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:27,390
together

186
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:28,020
to

187
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:28,320
form

188
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,160
multicellular

00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:29,910
organisms.

190
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:30,930
This

191
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:31,230
keeps

192
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:31,530
going

193
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:32,070

00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:33,060

196
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:33,210

Civilization

208
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:38,250
be

00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:43,020
And

219
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:43,290
then

220
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:43,410
they

221
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:43,590
need

222
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:43,740
to

223
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:44,190
actually

224
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:44,610
venture

225
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:44,850
out

00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:45,390

230
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:46,410
We

231
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:46,440
don’t

232
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:46,650
really

233
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:46,710
know

234
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:46,770
how

235
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:46,890
hard

236
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:46,980
these

237
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:47,010
steps

238
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:47,040
are

239
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:47,070
or

240
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:47,130
how

241
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:47,250
many

242

them

244
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:47,430
are

245
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:47,670
necessary.

246
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:47,700
On

life

249
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:48,840
appeared

250
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:49,410
basically

251
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:49,560
as

252
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:49,830
soon

253
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:49,950
as

254
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:50,040

00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:50,910
formed.

257
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:51,630
But

258
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:52,020
then

259
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:52,260
it

260
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:52,470
took

00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:52,800
two

00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:53,640

289
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:05,010

00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:11,610
Also,

303
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,120

433
00:02:59,670 --> 00:02:59,700

434
00:02:59,730 --> 00:02:59,820
this

435
00:02:59,820 --> 00:02:59,910
time

436
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:00,000
in

437
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,060
the

438
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:00,270
Universe?

439
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:02,880
The

440
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:03,330
universe

441
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:03,450
is

442
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:03,810
already

443
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:04,500
13.8

444
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:05,160
billion

445
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:05,430
years

446
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:05,700
old,

447
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:06,300
but

448
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:06,630
it is

449
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:07,350
unlikely

450
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:07,530
that

451
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:07,860
many

452
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:08,190

technological

454
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:09,750
civilizations

455
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:09,960
had a

456
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,410
chance

457
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:10,530
to

458
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:10,830
appear

459
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:11,250
before

460
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:11,580
us.

461
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:12,750
Because

462
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:12,840
in

463
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:12,990
the

465
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:13,980
Universe

466
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:14,460
life

467
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:14,610
would

468
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:14,670
have

469
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:15,090

470
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:15,420

471
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:15,690

472
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:15,960

473
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:16,140
to

474
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:16,650
emerge,

475
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:16,980
let

476
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:17,310

477
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:17,850
thrive,

478
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:18,510
because

479
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:18,540
it

480
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:18,690
was

481
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:18,870
such

482
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:18,930
a

483
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:19,440
hostile

484
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:20,130
environment.

485
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:21,270
Early

486
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:21,810
stars

487
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:22,440
constantly

488
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:22,710
blew

489
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:22,950

00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:23,760
galaxies

491
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,150
crashed

492
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:24,360

00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:24,540

00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:24,810
other

495
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:25,380

496
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,220
supermassive

497

00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:28,020

00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:28,410

00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:28,530

503
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,160
radiation.

504
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,150
Enough

505
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:30,300
to

506
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:30,960
sterilize

507
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,530

511
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:32,670

512
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:33,750
Our

513
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:34,170
Sun

514
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:34,380
was

515
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:34,710
born

516
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:35,040
right

517
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,100
at

518
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:35,250
the

520
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:35,730
of

521
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:35,970
this

522
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,600
cosmic

523
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:36,900
death

524
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:37,230
show.

525
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:38,070
The

526
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:38,610
Universe

527
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:38,760
has

528
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,000
never

529
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,180

00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:39,360
more

531
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:39,960
welcoming

532
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:40,080

00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:40,410
life

534
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:40,590
than

535
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:40,860
it is

536
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:41,220
now.

537
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:42,270
So

538
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:42,930
humanity

539
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,140

00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:43,740

547
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,110
maybe

548
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:46,260
the

life

554
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:48,240
to

555
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:48,810
thrive.

556
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:49,770
What

557
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:49,980
about

558
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:50,040
the

00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:50,610
future?

560
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:51,600
The

561
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:51,990
Sun

562
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:52,410
burns

563
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:52,770
brighter

564
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:52,950
than

565
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:53,250
90%

566
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:53,820

572
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:55,650
and

573
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:55,860
will

574
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:56,220
keep

575
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:56,580
getting

576
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:57,030
brighter.

577
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:57,810
In

578
00:03:57,810 --> 00:03:58,110
about

00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:58,950
years,

582
00:03:59,100 --> 00:03:59,280
it

583
00:03:59,280 --> 00:03:59,430
will

584
00:03:59,430 --> 00:03:59,790
boil

585
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:00,060
all

00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:00,480
Earth’s

589
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:01,290
and

590
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:01,440
then

591
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:01,740
become

592
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:01,800
a

whole.

598
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:04,530
So in

605
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:06,900
very

606
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:07,590
short-lived.

607
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:08,610
Most

00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:15,780
Life

00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:15,960

862
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:53,370
We

863
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:53,520
could

864
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:53,910

00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:55,770
allowing

00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:56,100
us to

875
00:05:58,920 --> 00:05:59,280
If we

880
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:00,870

881
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:01,260

A

910
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:13,770
Imagine

946
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:28,560

00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:37,560
it is

00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:37,860
very

972
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:38,430
disruptive

973
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:38,550

Not

997

00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:50,220
it’s

1002
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:50,640
simply

1003
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:50,820

they

00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:52,410
that

we

1021
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:55,260
needed

wood.

1023
00:06:56,370 --> 00:06:57,150
Similarly,

1081
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:18,750

The

00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:20,310

00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:20,490

00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:20,970
trillions

1087
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:21,060
of

00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:21,330
years

1089
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:21,450

life,

1092
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:22,620
but

1093
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:22,740
there

1094
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:22,980

00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:25,920
thrive.

1104
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,000
Even

1105
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:27,240
if a

1106
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:27,540
loud

00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:30,960
and

1114
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:31,530
expands

1115
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:31,860
around

1116
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:32,100
them,

1117
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:32,520
like

1118
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:32,910
humans

1119
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:33,120

civilization

1125
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,000

such

00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:36,300
a

planet

1129
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:37,020
would

not

00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:37,710
able

1133
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:37,860
to

1134
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:38,490
expand,

1135
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:38,880
ever.

1136
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,080
Trapped

1137
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:40,650
forever

1138
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:41,070
on a

1139
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:41,460
tiny

00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:41,970
island.

1141
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:43,020
But

1142
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:43,260
here

1143
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:43,410
we

1144
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:43,740
are,

1145
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:44,400
so

1146
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:44,820
Loud

1147
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:45,330
aliens

1148
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:45,630
were

1149
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:46,050
probably

1150
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:46,320
never

1151
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:46,680
here.

1152
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:47,760
What

1153
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:48,060
about

1154
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:48,480
aliens

1155
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:48,690
that

1156
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:48,990
don’t

1157
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:49,650
expand?

1158
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:50,670
They

1159
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:50,730
would

1160
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:51,000
be

1161
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:51,450
‘Quiet’

1162
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:52,050
aliens.

1163
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:52,800
They’re

1164
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,250
probably

1165
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:53,670
limited

1166
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:53,790
to

1167
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:54,030
one

system

1170
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:55,320
and

1171
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:55,530
don’t

1172
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:55,710
have

1173
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:55,740
a

1174
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:56,280
noticeable

1175
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:56,760
impact

1176
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:56,880
on

1177
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:57,030
their

1178
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:57,480

00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,260
surroundings.

1180
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,280
Humanity

1181
00:07:59,280 --> 00:07:59,460
is

1182
00:07:59,640 --> 00:07:59,670
like

1183
00:07:59,670 --> 00:07:59,910
this

1184
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:00,150
right

1185
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:00,600
now.

1186
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:01,230
We

1187
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:01,380
wouldn’t

1188
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:01,590
be

1189
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:01,770
able

1190
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:01,890
to

1191
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:02,370
detect

1192
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:02,910
ourselves

1193
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:03,060
from

1194
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:03,150
the

1195
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:03,300
other

1196
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:03,570
side

1197
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:03,660
of

1198
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:03,720
the

1199
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,050
Milky

1200
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:04,380
Way.

1201
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:05,250
If

1202
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:05,400
they

1203
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:05,640
stay

1204
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:05,970
quiet

1205
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:06,450
forever,

1206
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:06,900
maybe

1207
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:07,140
because

1208
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:07,260
of

1209
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:07,410
their

00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:07,890
culture

1211
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:08,100
or

1212
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:08,610
abilities,

1213
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,090
then

1214
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:09,240
they

1215
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:09,330
are

1216
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:09,660
not

1217
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:09,960
really

1218
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:10,140
a

1219
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:10,650
concern

1220
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:10,830
for

1221
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:11,190
us.

1222
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:12,180
We

1223
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:12,480
only

1224
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:12,750
have

1225
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:12,990
one

1226
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:13,440
sample

1227
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:13,560
to

1228
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:13,800
draw

1229
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,220
from:

1230
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,270
Humanity,

1231
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:15,630
and

1232
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:15,870
right

1233
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:16,320
now

1234
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:16,710
we

1235
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:17,070
are

1236
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:17,190
on

1237
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:17,280
the

1238
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:17,670
path

1239
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:17,790
to

1240
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:18,210
becoming

1241
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:18,660
loud.

1242
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:20,010
If we

1243
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:20,040
are

1244
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:20,340
not

1245
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:20,880
special,

1246
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:21,120
and

1247
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:21,600
succeed

1248
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,080
anyway,

1249
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:22,530
then

1250
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:22,800
any

1251
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,010
other

1252
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:23,790
civilization

1253
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:23,940
with

1254
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:24,000
the

1255
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,600
motivation

1256
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:24,810
and

1257
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:25,410
resources

1258
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:25,740
to

1259
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:26,100
would

1260
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:26,550
eventually

1261
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:27,060
expand

1262
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:27,600
beyond

1263
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:27,750
its

1264
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:28,080
planet

1265
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:28,170
of

1266
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:28,590
origin.

1267
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:29,970
Ok,

1268
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:30,360
what

1269
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:30,420
is

1270
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:30,510
the

1271
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,290
consequence

1272
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:31,320
of

1273
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:31,560
all

1274
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:31,770
these

1275
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:32,370
assumptions

1276
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:32,580
and

1277
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:33,270
ideas?

1278
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:35,070
Grave

1279
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:36,030

Race

1281
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:36,960
to

1282
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:37,050
the

1283
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:37,680
Stars

1284
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:39,090
If we

1285
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:39,330
are

1286
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:39,660
really

1287
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:40,080
early,

1288
00:08:40,170 --> 00:08:40,440
then

1289
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,010
eventually,

1290
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:41,460
others

1291
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:41,610
will

1292
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:41,880
catch

1293
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:42,030
up

1294
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:42,180
with

1295
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:42,510
us.

1296
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:44,040
Civilizations

1297
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:44,160
will

1298
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:44,520
emerge

1299
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:44,670
all

1300
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:44,940
over

00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:45,030
the

00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:45,450
place.

1303
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:46,110
And

1304
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:46,380
these

1305
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:46,590

aliens

1307
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:47,160
will

1308
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:47,340
look

1309
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:47,430
at

1310
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:47,850
space,

1311
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,300
see

1312
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:48,450
no

1313
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:48,840

1314
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:48,930

00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:49,290
life

1316
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:49,680
and

00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:49,920
come

1318
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:50,040
to

1319
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:50,130
the

00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:50,430
same

1321
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:51,060
conclusion:

1322
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:51,780
they

1323
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:52,260
exist

1324
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:52,560
because

1325
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:52,890
Loud

1326
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:53,700
civilizations

1327
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:53,790

1330
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:54,540
taken

1331
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:54,810
over

1332
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,320
everything,

1333
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:55,830
but

1334
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:55,920
it

1335
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:56,100
only

1336
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:56,430
takes

00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:56,760
one

1338
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,090
Loud

civilization

1340
00:08:58,110 --> 00:08:58,260
to

crowd

1342
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:58,680
them

1343
00:08:58,680 --> 00:08:58,980
out

1344
00:08:58,980 --> 00:08:59,070
of

00:08:59,070 --> 00:08:59,220
the

entire

galaxy.

1348
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:01,590
They,

1349
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:01,890
like

1350
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:02,190
us,

1351
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:02,520
will

1352
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:02,880
face

1353
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:03,060
an

1354
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:03,630
important

1355
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:04,050
decision:

1356
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:04,800
do

1357
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,040
they

1358
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:05,370
stay

1359
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:05,850
Quiet,

1360
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:06,420
take

1361
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:06,540
it

1362
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:06,990
easy

1363
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:07,410
and

1364
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:07,680
tend

1365
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:07,770
to

1366
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:07,950
their

00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:08,310
planet

1368
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:08,460
for

1369
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:08,610
as

1370
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:08,790
long

1371
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:08,940
as

1372
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:09,510
possible,

1373
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:10,110
or do

1374
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:10,230
they

1375
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:10,650
start

1376
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:11,370
expanding

1377
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:11,640
to

1378
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:11,850
take

1379
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:11,910
a

1380
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:12,300
chunk

1381
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:12,360
of

1382
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:12,450
the

1383
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:12,960
galaxy,

1384
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:13,560
before

1385
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:13,890
someone

1386
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:14,130
else

1387
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:14,700
arrives?

1388
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:16,260
Meeting

1389
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:16,710
others

1390
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:17,040
does

1391
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:17,310
not

1392
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:18,060
necessarily

1393
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:18,300
mean

1394
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:18,750
war

1395
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:18,900
or

1396
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:19,560
conflict.

1397
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:20,280
But

1398
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:20,370
it

1399
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:20,610
means

1400
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:20,760
that

1401
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:20,940
new

1402
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:21,420
borders

1403
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:21,570
will

1404
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:22,110
arise,

1405
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:22,710
limits

1406
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:22,890
that

1407
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:23,070
may

1408
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:23,550
persist

1409
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:24,090
forever.

1410
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:24,930
In

1411
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:24,990
the

1412
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:25,380
worst

1413
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:25,800
case,

1414
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:26,130
a

1415
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:26,910
civilization

1416
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:27,090
could

1417
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:27,210
be

1418
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:27,780
completely

1419
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:28,350
enveloped

1420
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:28,500
by

1421
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:28,650
the

1422
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:29,250
empires

1423
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:29,370
of

1424
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:29,730
others,

1425
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:30,600
eternally

1426
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,080
doomed

1427
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:31,350
to be

1428
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:31,410
a

1429
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:31,980
galactic

1430
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:32,730
backwater,

1431
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:33,360
without

1432
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,050
control

1433
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:34,380
over

1434
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:34,560
their

1435
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,040
fate.

1436
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,240
So if

1437
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:36,360
we

1438
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:36,570
want

1439
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:36,630
a

1440
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:36,990
seat

1441
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:37,050
at

1442
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:37,140
the

1443
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:37,740
galactic

1444
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:38,220
adults’

00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:38,730
table,

1446
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:39,090
we

1447
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:39,420
best

1448
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:39,600
get

1449
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:39,720
to

1450
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,200
work.

1451
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:41,160
If we

1452
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:41,460
really

1453
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:41,700
are

1454
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:42,090
early,

1455
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:42,450
we

1456
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:42,780
have

1457
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:42,960
an

1458
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:43,710
incredible

1459
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:44,520
opportunity.

1460
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:45,210
To

1461
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:45,570
mold

1462
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,170
thousands

1463
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:46,410
or

1464
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:46,770
even

1465
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:47,310
millions

1466
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:47,460
of

00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:47,910
planets

1468
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:48,540
according

1469
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:48,720
to

1470
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:48,900
our

00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:49,380
vision

1472
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:49,740
and

1473
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:50,400
dreams.

1474
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:51,390
And

1475
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:51,810
one

1476
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,110
day,

1477
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:52,350
when

1478
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:52,470
we

1479
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:52,740
meet

1480
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:53,160
others,

1481
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:53,580
we

1482
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:53,790
can

1483
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:54,060
greet

1484
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:54,360
them

1485
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:54,660
and

1486
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:54,990
meet

1487
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:55,320
them
